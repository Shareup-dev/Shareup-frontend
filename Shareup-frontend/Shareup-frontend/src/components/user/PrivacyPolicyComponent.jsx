DATA BREACH</b>
<br/>
<br/>
A privacy breach occurs when there is unauthorized access to or collection, use, disclosure, or disposal of personal information. 
You will be notified about data breaches when <b class="font-weight-bold">“Shareup”</b> believes you are likely to be at risk of serious harm. For example, a data breach may be
 likely to result in serious financial harm or harm to your mental or physical well-being.

No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser

 we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy policy.

Our Services offer you the ability to register and login using your third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or Twitter logins).

may vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your name, e-mail address, friends list, profile picture as well as
 other information you choose to make public.   
 <br/>
<br/>  
We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this privacy policy or that are otherwise made clear to you on the
 Services. Please note that we do not control and are not responsible for other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media

  set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.

 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Qatari Law No. 13 of 2016 ("the Personal Data Privacy Protection Law") took effect in 2017, with the aim of protecting and providing
  guidelines of processing personal data within Qatar. In December 2020, the Compliance and Data Protection Department (CDP) within the Ministry of
   Transport and Communications (MOTC) published new guidelines in relation to the Law. The scope of the PDPPL applies to personal data that is received,
  collected, extracted, or processed through electronic or traditional methods.
  <br/>
 <br/>
Any organization that processes such personal data must adhere to the principles of transparency, fairness, and respect for human dignity. 
The law has a large focus on organizations ensuring that the personal data they process is up to date and there are adequate measures in place
 for safe custody of the personal data.

<br/>
<br/>
Egypt published a Personal Data Protection Law in July 2020 that addresses the right to personal data protection and gives multiple rights to 
individuals. 
According to the Law, personal data should only be collected for specific legitimate purposes and should not be retained longer than necessary. 
Organizations may need to acquire a license to process both personal and sensitive personal data. Additionally, organizations involved in the processing 
of personal information are expected to appoint an authorized Data Protection Officer (DPO) who will be responsible for the application of this law
 within the organization. 
The Personal Data Protection Law has provisions for administrative fines and criminal penalties for non-compliance which could be up to a maximum of
<b class="font-weight-bold text-justify" style={{fontSize:'12'}}> EGP 5m</b> or a potential sentence of
 <b class="font-weight-bold text-justify" style={{fontSize:'16'}}> imprisonment of more than six months.</b>

<br/>
<br/>
The DIFC Data Protection Law (DIFC Law No. 5 of 2020) has been effective since 1 July 2020 and enforceable as of 1 October 2020. The DIFC law aims 
to safeguard the personal data of individuals whose data is processed by DIFC registered entities. It is heavily influenced by the EU General Data 
Protection Regulation (GDPR) as well as other world-class data protection laws.
<br/>
<br/>
Some of the key features of the new law include the clarification of data subjects’ rights, the facilitation of appropriate data sharing structures
 between governmental authorities, as well as the introduction of a framework that will support the DIFC’s bid for adequacy recognition by the European
  Commission and the UK, which will enable data transfers from the DIFC to the EU and the UK. Organizations may be subject to fines for non-compliance.
