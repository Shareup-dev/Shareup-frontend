 court and have a jury trial”.</i>
 <br/>
<br/>
The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American 
Arbitration Association ("AAA") and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer 
Related Disputes ("AAA Consumer Rules"), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org. Your 
arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and, 
where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the
 submission of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not 
 provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either Party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law,
  and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by the 
  applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in “Qatar”. Except as otherwise 
  provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending 
  arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.
  <br/>
<br/>
If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or 
prosecuted in the state and federal courts located in “Qatar “and the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all
 defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non convenient with respect to venue and jurisdiction in
  such state and federal courts. Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International 
  Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are excluded from these Terms of Use.
<br/>
<br/>
If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither party will elect to arbitrate any 
dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such dispute 
shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the 
Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.
